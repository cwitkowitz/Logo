This workspace contains the Python Turtle Graphics code which was used to create my website logo, and the various graphic designs on display in the artwork section. There are several tools which aide in the reuse of graphic code for my various designs. The code will be cleaned up in the future, and I will hopefully continue to add cool designs.

If you wish to save the drawings as images after running, you must create a directory called 'postscript' under the output directory, and enable the SAVE_IMG parameter in the respective graphic file. This functionality requires the following
    Ghostscript https://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html
    Pillow (pip install)
